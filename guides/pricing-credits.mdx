Audixa uses a credit-based billing system. This guide explains how credits work, how they're calculated, and how to manage your balance.

## How Credits Work

Every API call consumes credits based on:
1. **Text length** (measured in tokens, approximately 1 token ≈ 1 character)
2. **Voice model** (Base or Advance)

<Info>
  New accounts receive **10,000 free credits** to get started.
</Info>

## Credit Calculation

The credit cost depends on which model you use:

| Model | Credit Cost | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Base** | 1 credit per token | Standard voices, high volume |
| **Advance** | 4 credits per token | Custom voices, cloning, emotions |

### Example Calculations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Base Model">
    **Text:** "Welcome to our product demo." (30 characters)
    
    **Calculation:** 30 tokens × 1 credit = **30 credits**
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advance Model">
    **Text:** "Welcome to our product demo." (30 characters)
    
    **Calculation:** 30 tokens × 4 credits = **120 credits**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  Tokens are approximately equal to characters, including spaces and punctuation.
</Note>

## Checking Your Balance

Your credit balance is visible in the [Audixa Dashboard](https://audixa.ai/dashboard).

<Warning>
  Credit balance is not exposed via the API. Use the dashboard to monitor your usage.
</Warning>

## Insufficient Balance

When your credits run out, API requests return a `402 Payment Required` error:

<ResponseExample>
```json 402 Payment Required
{
  "detail": "Insufficient Balance"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

### Handling This Error

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
response = requests.post("https://api.audixa.ai/v2/tts", ...)

if response.status_code == 402:
    print("Insufficient credits. Please add funds at https://audixa.ai/dashboard/billing")
```

```javascript JavaScript
if (response.status === 402) {
  console.log("Insufficient credits. Please add funds.");
  // Optionally redirect user to billing page
}
```
