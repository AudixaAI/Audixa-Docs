Audixa AI offers two powerful text-to-speech models to suit different needs: **Base** and **Advanced**. Each model is optimized for a different set of use cases, from general-purpose narration to highly expressive, custom voice generation.

Understanding the differences will help you choose the best model for your application.

## Base Model

The Base model is the perfect choice for a wide range of applications. It is designed for reliability, speed, and high-quality audio output across a large and diverse voice library.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="54 Voices" icon="users">
    Extensive library spanning various accents, genders, and styles.
  </Card>
  <Card title="High Quality" icon="waveform-lines">
    Clear, natural-sounding speech for narration and content creation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simple" icon="rocket">
    Easy to use with straightforward API parameters.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

For the majority of users, the Base model provides more than enough variety and quality to build incredible audio experiences.

## Advanced Model

The Advanced model is built for users who require the highest level of customization, expressiveness, and unique vocal identity. While it has a smaller library of preset voices, its power lies in its advanced features.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Voice Cloning" icon="clone">
    Create a digital replica of any voice from a short audio sample.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Voices" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Design unique, high-quality synthetic voices tailored to your brand.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Superior Expressiveness" icon="face-smile">
    Fine-tuned for more nuanced and emotionally resonant speech.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Greater Customization" icon="sliders">
    Detailed control over expressiveness settings like `cfg_weight` and `exaggeration`.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The Advanced model is ideal for enterprises, creators, and developers who need a signature voice or the flexibility of voice cloning.

## Specifying a Model in Your API Request

To use a specific model, set the `model` parameter in your API request:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Base Model">
```json
{
  "text": "Hello, this is a voice from the Base model.",
  "voice_id": "am_ethan",
  "model": "base"
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced Model">
```json
{
  "text": "Hello, this is a voice from the Advanced model.",
  "voice_id": "am_ethan",
  "model": "advanced",
  "cfg_weight": 3.5,
  "exaggeration": 0.7
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### SDK Examples

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import audixa

audixa.set_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY")

# Using Base model
audio_url = audixa.tts_and_wait(
    "Hello from the Base model.",
    voice_id="am_ethan",
    model="base",
)

# Using Advanced model with expressiveness settings
audio_url = audixa.tts_and_wait(
    "Hello from the Advanced model!",
    voice_id="am_ethan",
    model="advanced",
    cfg_weight=3.5,
    exaggeration=0.7,
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Audixa from 'audixa';

const audixa = new Audixa('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Using Base model
const baseAudio = await audixa.generateTTS({
  text: 'Hello from the Base model.',
  voice_id: 'am_ethan',
  model: 'base'
});

// Using Advanced model with expressiveness settings
const advancedAudio = await audixa.generateTTS({
  text: 'Hello from the Advanced model!',
  voice_id: 'am_ethan',
  model: 'advanced',
  cfg_weight: 3.5,
  exaggeration: 0.7
});
```

```javascript JavaScript
import Audixa from 'audixa';

const audixa = new Audixa('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Using Base model
const baseAudio = await audixa.generateTTS({
  text: 'Hello from the Base model.',
  voice_id: 'am_ethan',
  model: 'base'
});

// Using Advanced model with expressiveness settings
const advancedAudio = await audixa.generateTTS({
  text: 'Hello from the Advanced model!',
  voice_id: 'am_ethan',
  model: 'advanced',
  cfg_weight: 3.5,
  exaggeration: 0.7
});
```
