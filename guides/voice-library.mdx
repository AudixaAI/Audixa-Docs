Audixa offers a diverse library of high-quality voices. This guide explains how to browse, select, and use voices in your API requests.

## Voice Models

Audixa provides two model tiers:

| Model | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Base** | Standard high-quality voices | General TTS, high volume, cost-effective |
| **Advanced** | Premium voices with cloning and emotions | Custom voices, expressive speech, dubbing |

## Listing Voices via API

Fetch available voices using the `/voices` endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
# Get Base model voices
curl -X GET "https://api.audixa.ai/v3/voices?model=base" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"

# Get Advanced model voices
curl -X GET "https://api.audixa.ai/v3/voices?model=advanced" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import audixa

audixa.set_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY")

# Get Base model voices
voices = audixa.list_voices(model="base")
for voice in voices:
    print(f"{voice['name']} ({voice['voice_id']}) - {voice.get('accent', 'N/A')}")

# Get Advanced model voices
advanced_voices = audixa.list_voices(model="advanced")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Audixa from 'audixa';

const audixa = new Audixa('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Get Base model voices
const { voices } = await audixa.getVoices({ model: 'base' });
for (const voice of voices) {
  console.log(`${voice.name} (${voice.voice_id}) - ${voice.accent ?? 'N/A'}`);
}
```

```javascript JavaScript
import Audixa from 'audixa';

const audixa = new Audixa('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Get Base model voices
const { voices } = await audixa.getVoices({ model: 'base' });
voices.forEach(voice => {
  console.log(`${voice.name} (${voice.voice_id}) - ${voice.accent || 'N/A'}`);
});
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The `model` query parameter is optional. Use `base` or `advanced` to filter.
</Note>

}

</ResponseExample>

## Voice Properties

Each voice object includes:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `voice_id` | string | Unique identifier to use in `/tts` requests |
| `name` | string | Human-friendly voice name |
| `gender` | string | `Male` or `Female` |
| `accent` | string | Voice accent/language (e.g., "American") |
| `description` | string | Brief description of voice characteristics |
| `free` | boolean | Whether the voice is free to use |
| `is_custom` | boolean | Whether this is your custom voice |

## Using a Voice

Once you've selected a voice, use its `voice_id` in your TTS request:

```json
{
  "text": "Hello, this is a test.",
  "voice_id": "am_ethan",
  "model": "base"
}
```

<Warning>
  Make sure the `model` in your TTS request matches the model the voice belongs to.
</Warning>

## Custom Voices (Advanced Model)

## Voice Selection Tips

1. **Match your audience**: Choose accents that resonate with your target users
2. **Consider context**: Professional content may need authoritative voices; casual content benefits from friendly tones
3. **Test before production**: Generate samples with different voices before committing
4. **Check the dashboard**: The [Voice Library](https://audixa.ai/dashboard/library) lets you preview voices interactively
