Audixa offers a diverse library of high-quality voices. This guide explains how to browse, select, and use voices in your API requests.

## Voice Models

Audixa provides two model tiers:

| Model | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Base** | Standard high-quality voices | General TTS, high volume, cost-effective |
| **Advance** | Premium voices with cloning and emotions | Custom voices, expressive speech, dubbing |

## Listing Voices via API

Fetch available voices using the `/voices` endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
# Get Base model voices
curl -X GET "https://api.audixa.ai/v2/voices?model=base" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"

# Get Advance model voices
curl -X GET "https://api.audixa.ai/v2/voices?model=advance" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import requests

# Get Base model voices
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.audixa.ai/v2/voices",
    params={"model": "base"},
    headers={"x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
)

voices = response.json()["voices"]
for voice in voices:
    print(f"{voice['name']} ({voice['voice_id']}) - {voice['accent']}")
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.audixa.ai/v2/voices?model=base",
  { headers: { "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY" } }
);

const data = await response.json();
data.voices.forEach(voice => {
  console.log(`${voice.name} (${voice.voice_id}) - ${voice.accent}`);
});
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The `model` query parameter is **required**. Use `base` or `advance`.
</Note>

## Voice Properties

Each voice object includes:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `voice_id` | string | Unique identifier to use in `/tts` requests |
| `name` | string | Human-friendly voice name |
| `gender` | string | `male` or `female` |
| `accent` | string | Voice accent/language (e.g., "American English") |
| `description` | string | Brief description of voice characteristics |

## Using a Voice

Once you've selected a voice, use its `voice_id` in your TTS request:

```json
{
  "text": "Hello, this is a test.",
  "voice": "aura-asteria-en",
  "model": "base"
}
```

<Warning>
  Make sure the `model` in your TTS request matches the model the voice belongs to.
</Warning>

## Custom Voices (Advance Model)

## Voice Selection Tips

1. **Match your audience**: Choose accents that resonate with your target users
2. **Consider context**: Professional content may need authoritative voices; casual content benefits from friendly tones
3. **Test before production**: Generate samples with different voices before committing
4. **Check the dashboard**: The [Voice Library](https://audixa.ai/dashboard/library) lets you preview voices interactively
