Audixa uses a transparent pay-as-you-go billing system. Your cost depends on your subscription plan and the model you choose.

## Plan-Based Pricing

Lower-tier plans have valid Pay-as-you-go rates, while higher-tier plans unlock significantly cheaper rates for high-volume usage.

| Plan | Monthly Price | Monthly Balance | Base Model Cost (per 1k chars) | Advanced Model Cost (per 1k chars) |
|------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Basic** | Free | $0.10 (Trial) | $0.001 | $0.08 |
| **Starter** | $14 / month | $15 | $0.006 | $0.04 |
| **Pro** | $29 / month | $30 | $0.003 | $0.02 |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Custom | Custom |

<Note>
  **Token Calculation:**
  Costs are calculated based on the number of characters (tokens).
  - **1,000 characters** (tokens) ≈ **1 minute** of generated audio.
</Note>

## How Costs Work

Every API call has a cost based on:
1. **Character Count** (Input text length)
2. **Voice model** (Base or Advanced)
3. **Your Plan** (Basic, Starter, or Pro rates)

<Info>
  New accounts receive **$0.10 in free balance** to get started on the Basic plan.
</Info>

## Cost Example

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Plan">
    **Scenario:** Generate 10,000 characters using **Base Model**.
    
    **Calculation:** (10,000 / 1,000) * $0.001 = $0.01
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Starter Plan">
    **Scenario:** Generate 10,000 characters using **Advanced Model**.
    
    **Calculation:** (10,000 / 1,000) * $0.04 = $0.40
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Checking Your Balance

Your available balance (Monthly + Topup) is visible in the [Audixa Dashboard](https://audixa.ai/dashboard).

<Warning>
  Balance details are not exposed via the API. Use the dashboard to monitor your usage.
</Warning>

## Insufficient Balance

When your balance runs out, API requests return a `402 Payment Required` error:

<ResponseExample>
```json 402 Payment Required
{
  "detail": "Insufficient Balance"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

### Handling This Error

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
response = requests.post("https://api.audixa.ai/v3/tts", ...)

if response.status_code == 402:
    print("Insufficient balance. Please add funds at https://audixa.ai/dashboard/billing")
```

```javascript JavaScript
if (response.status === 402) {
  console.log("Insufficient balance. Please add funds.");
  // Optionally redirect user to billing page
}
```
</CodeGroup>
