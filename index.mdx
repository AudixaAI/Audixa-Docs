## How It Works

Audixa uses an **asynchronous workflow** for audio generation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit Request">
    Send your text to the `/tts` endpoint with your chosen voice and settings. You'll receive a `generation_id` immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Poll Status">
    Check the `/status` endpoint with your `generation_id` to monitor progress.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download Audio">
    Once complete, the status response includes an `url` to download your WAV file.
  </Step>
</Steps>
