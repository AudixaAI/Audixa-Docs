The Generations page is your central hub for viewing and managing your complete text-to-speech generation history. Every time you create audio, whether through the dashboard or the API, a record of that job appears here.

## Audio File Retention Policy

<Warning>
  **Important Data Policy**: Audio files generated on our platform are only stored and available for download for **7 days**.
  
  After 7 days, the generation record (including the text, status, and voice used) will remain in your history, but the audio file itself will be purged and will no longer be downloadable.
  
  Please be sure to download any essential audio files within this 7-day window.
</Warning>
