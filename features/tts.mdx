The **Text-to-Speech** dashboard allows you to convert text into natural-sounding speech using Audixa's state-of-the-art AI models.

## The Generation Workflow

1. **Select Your Model:** Choose between the **Base Model** for speed and reliability, or the **Advanced Model** for higher quality and expressiveness.
2. **Choose Your Voice:** Pick from our extensive library of preset voices or use your own **Clone Voices**.
3. **Enter Your Text:** Type or paste your script.
4. **Settings (Optional):** Adjust speed, language, or advanced controls.
5. **Generate:** Create your audio.

## Model Selection

You can switch between two models depending on your needs:

- **Base Model:** Best for general-purpose use. Optimized for speed and reliability.
- **Advanced Model:** Offers HD voices and advanced expressiveness controls. Required for using **Clone Voices**.

## Quick Presets

To help you get started, we provide several one-click presets for common use cases:
- **Casual Conversation**
- **Professional Narration**

## Settings

### Voice Selection
Click the voice selector to open the Voice Modal. You can filter by:
- **Accent**
- **Gender** (Male, Female, Neutral)
- **Free Voices**

### Base Model Settings
When the Base Model is selected, you can adjust:
- **Language:** Select from available languages (e.g., American English).
- **Speed:** Adjust playback speed from **0.5x** to **2.0x**.

### Advanced Model Settings
These settings provide granular control over the vocal performance and are only available with the Advanced Model.

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CFG Weight** | Controls the guidance strength (1.0 - 5.0). Higher values force the model to follow the text and style more strictly. |
| **Exaggeration** | Controls the expressiveness (0.0 - 1.0). Higher values result in more dramatic emotional fluctuation. |

### Output Format
Choose your preferred file format:
- **MP3:** Compressed, smaller file size (standard).
- **WAV:** Uncompressed, lossless quality.
