The Billing page is your central hub for managing your subscription, wallet balances, and viewing transaction history.

## The Billing Dashboard

The dashboard uses a grid layout to show your most important financial data at a glance.

### 1. Total Available Balance
The large card shows your **Total Available Balance**, which is the sum of your:
- **Monthly Balance:** Included with your plan (resets monthly).
- **Topup Balance:** Purchased separately (never expires).

### 2. Add Funds (Topup)
You can add funds to your **Topup Balance** at any time. This balance is used when your monthly balance runs out, ensuring uninterrupted service.

- **Pre-set Amounts:** $10, $25, $50, $100.
- **Custom Amount:** Enter any amount between $10 and $1,000.
- **Payment:** Securely processed via our payment provider.

### 3. Active Plan Card
Shows your current subscription tier and its benefits, such as:
- Monthly balance amount
- Concurrent request limits
- Feature access (e.g., Clone Voices)

## Managing Your Subscription
Click the **Manage Subscription** button on your active plan card to open the subscription portal. Here you can:
- **Upgrade/Downgrade:** Change your plan.
- **Update Payment Method:** Change your card details.
- **Cancel Subscription:** Stop auto-renewal.
- **View Invoices:** Download past PDF invoices.

<Note>
  If you cancel, you will see a cancellation banner with the end date. You can revoke cancellation at any time before that date to keep your plan active.
</Note>

## Wallet System Explained

Audixa uses a **Dual Wallet System**:
1. **Monthly Balance:** Consumed first. Resets on your billing cycle. Unused amounts do NOT roll over.
2. **Topup Balance:** Consumed only after Monthly Balance is exhausted. Carries over indefinitely.

## Billing History
The bottom section contains tabs for:
- **Payments:** History of your subscription charges and top-ups.
- **Generations:** Detailed log of balance usage per generation.
