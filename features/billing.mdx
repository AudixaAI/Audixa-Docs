The Billing & Subscription page is your central hub to manage your plan, add funds to your wallet, and view your complete invoice history.

## Subscription Details

This section shows the current status of your monthly or annual subscription. What you see here depends on whether you are on the free (Basic) plan or a paid plan.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Paid Plans">
    If you are on a **Starter** or **Pro** plan, this card will show:
    - Your active plan name
    - The next renewal date
    - Your monthly usage percentage
    - The payment method on file
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Basic Plan">
    If you are on the Basic plan, this card will show "No Active Subscription" and provide an **Upgrade Now** button to select a paid plan.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managing Your Subscription

For paid plans, this section contains a **Manage Subscription** button. This button securely redirects you to our external payment provider's customer portal.

Inside this portal, you can:

- Update or change your payment method (credit card)
- Cancel your subscription
- View and download all past invoices

<Card title="Manage Subscription" icon="credit-card" href="https://audixa.ai/dashboard/billing">

## API Wallet Balance

The API Wallet is a separate, pay-as-you-go balance that you can add funds to at any time. Its primary purpose is to cover any overages on the Pro plan.

### Pro Plan Overage

<Note>
  Additional (pay-as-you-go) usage is an exclusive feature of the **Pro plan**. If you are on the Basic or Starter plan, your API access will be paused once you exhaust your monthly credits.
</Note>

Pro plan users can continue generating audio uninterrupted, and any usage beyond their plan's limit will be deducted from their API Wallet balance.

### How to Add Balance

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Balance">
    Click the **Add Balance** button on your billing page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    A dialog will appear prompting you to enter an amount in USD.
    
    <Warning>
      The amount must be a whole number (integer) and the minimum deposit is **$10**.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Payment">
    Clicking "Proceed" will take you to a secure payment page to complete the transaction. The funds will appear in your wallet shortly after.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Billing History

This section shows a list of your most recent invoices and payments. For a complete history, click the **View More** button.

Similar to the "Manage Subscription" button, this will redirect you to your secure customer portal, where you can see and download every invoice on your account.
