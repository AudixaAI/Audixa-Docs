**Custom Voices** let you create a **reusable** synthetic voice that's saved to your account. Once created, you can use this voice repeatedly — both in the dashboard and via the API — making it perfect for branding and consistent audio experiences.

<Note>
  Custom voices are saved to your account with a unique Voice ID for unlimited reuse. For one-time voice cloning, see [Instant Voice Cloning](/features/voice-cloning).
</Note>

## Custom Voices vs Instant Cloning

| Feature | Custom Voices | Instant Cloning |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Voice Saved?** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Reusable?** | ✅ Unlimited uses | ❌ Single use |
| **Voice ID Assigned?** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **API Access** | ✅ Yes | ❌ Dashboard only |
| **Best For** | Branding, ongoing use | Quick tests, one-off projects |

## How to Create a Custom Voice

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Dashboard">
    Log in to your account and go to the [Custom Voices page](https://audixa.ai/dashboard/custom).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Audio">
    Provide a high-quality audio sample of the voice you want to use as a base.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Your Voice">
    Assign a **Name** and **Gender** to your new voice for easy identification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Your Voice ID">
    Once processed, your new Custom Voice will be added to your library and assigned a unique Voice ID.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Creating custom voices is only available via the Dashboard as of now. We are working to add the API endpoint for it.
</Note>

## Using Your Custom Voice on the Dashboard

To use your custom voice via the Web Dashboard:

1. Head to the [Text to Speech Page](https://audixa.ai/dashboard/tts)
2. Select **Advance Model**
3. In the Voices menu, find your Custom Voice under "My Voices"

<Note>
  Custom voices are only supported in the **Advance Model**.
</Note>

## Using Your Custom Voice in the API

Your Custom Voice can be used programmatically via the API by referencing its unique Voice ID.

### Find Your Voice ID

Locate your voice on the dashboard's Custom Voices section and copy its Voice ID (e.g., `custom_voice_123`).

### Make the API Request

Set the `voice` parameter to your Voice ID and the `model` parameter to `"advance"`.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import audixa

audixa.set_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY")

audio_url = audixa.tts_and_wait(
    "This audio was generated with our unique and professional brand voice.",
    voice="custom_voice_456",
    model="advance",
    speed=1.0,
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Audixa from 'audixa';

const audixa = new Audixa('YOUR_API_KEY');

const audioUrl = await audixa.generateTTS({
  text: 'This audio was generated with our unique and professional brand voice.',
  voice: 'custom_voice_456',
  model: 'advance',
  speed: 1.0
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.audixa.ai/v2/tts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "text": "This audio was generated with our unique and professional brand voice.",
    "voice": "custom_voice_456",
    "model": "advance",
    "speed": 1.0
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Security and Access

Your Custom Voices are **exclusive to your account**.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Exclusive Access" icon="lock">
    Only the account that created a Custom Voice can use its Voice ID.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Protected Assets" icon="shield">
    If another user attempts to use your Custom Voice ID, the API returns a `400 Bad Request` error.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Error on Misuse:**

```json
{
  "detail": "Invalid voice ID"
}
```

## Billing

Custom Voices use the **Advance Model**. All audio generated is charged at the Advance model rate.

| Model | Credit Cost |
|-------|-------------|
| Base | 1 credit per token |
| **Advance (Custom Voices)** | 4 credits per token |

## Managing Your Voices

You have full control over your created voices. Management tasks, such as deleting a Custom Voice, can only be performed through the [Custom Voices section](https://audixa.ai/dashboard/custom) of your dashboard.

<Warning>
  Changing of the voice or metadata for a custom voice after creation is not allowed.
