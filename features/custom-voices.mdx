**Clone Voices** (also known as Custom Voices) allow you to train a personal voice model that you can use across all your projects. Once created, you can generate speech with this voice repeatedly using the **Advanced Model**.

<Note>
  Clone Voices result in a unique Voice ID saved to your account.

## Using Your Clone Voice on the Dashboard

1. Go to the [Text to Speech](https://audixa.ai/app/text-to-speech) page.
2. Select the **Advanced Model** (v2).
3. Open the Voice Selector.
4. Your created voices will appear under the **"Your Voices"** or **"Custom"** section.

## Using Your Clone Voice in the API

You can use your cloned voice programmatically by referencing its unique `voice_id`.

### 1. Find Your Voice ID
In the [Clone Voices dashboard](https://audixa.ai/app/custom-voices), find your voice in the "Your Voices" grid. You can copy the Voice ID from there (if available) or use the API to list your voices.

### 2. Make the API Request
Set the `voice_id` parameter to your Voice ID and the `model` parameter to `advanced`.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import audixa

audixa.set_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY")

audio_url = audixa.tts_and_wait(
    "This is my custom cloned voice.",
    voice_id="custom_voice_12345",
    model="advanced",  # Required for custom voices
    speed=1.0,
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Audixa from 'audixa';

const audixa = new Audixa('YOUR_API_KEY');

const audioUrl = await audixa.generateTTS({
  text: 'This is my custom cloned voice.',
  voice_id: 'custom_voice_12345',
  model: 'advanced'  // Required for custom voices
});
```

```javascript JavaScript
import Audixa from 'audixa';

const audixa = new Audixa('YOUR_API_KEY');

const audioUrl = await audixa.generateTTS({
  text: 'This is my custom cloned voice.',
  voice_id: 'custom_voice_12345',
  model: 'advanced'  // Required for custom voices
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.audixa.ai/v3/tts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "text": "This is my custom cloned voice.",
    "voice_id": "custom_voice_12345",
    "model": "advanced",
    "speed": 1.0
  }'
```
