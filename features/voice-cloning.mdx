description: "Generate audio with a cloned voice in a single step"
---

**Instant Voice Cloning** allows you to generate audio with a cloned voice in a single, streamlined process. Unlike Custom Voices, this feature is designed for **one-time use** — you upload an audio sample, enter your text, and receive the generated audio immediately.

<Note>
  This is a single-use feature. The cloned voice is **not saved** to your account. For reusable voices, see [Custom Voices](/features/custom-voices).
</Note>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Voice Cloning">
    Log in to your Audixa account and go to the [Voice Cloning page](https://audixa.ai/dashboard/clone).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Reference Audio">
    Upload a clear, high-quality audio file of the voice you wish to clone. For best results, use a sample with minimal background noise.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Your Text">
    Type or paste the text you want to convert to speech using the cloned voice.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Audio">
    Click Generate. The system will process your audio sample and generate speech in that voice immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download">
    Download your generated audio file. The cloned voice is not saved for future use.
  </Step>
